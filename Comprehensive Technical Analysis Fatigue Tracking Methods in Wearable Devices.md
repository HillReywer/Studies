## Executive Summary

Current wearable fatigue tracking systems achieve **80-85% accuracy** for physical fatigue detection through sophisticated heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, sleep quality assessment, and activity monitoring. However, significant gaps remain in differentiating mental and emotional fatigue types. **Garmin's Body Battery system**, powered by Firstbeat Analytics, represents the most technically mature implementation, while **Oura's Readiness Score** provides the most comprehensive multi-component approach with temporal weighting mechanisms.

## Overview of Existing Solutions

### Technical Maturity Landscape

The wearable fatigue tracking ecosystem comprises eight major platforms employing distinct algorithmic approaches, from simple heart rate-based calculations to sophisticated AI-driven multi-modal analysis systems.

**Garmin Body Battery** leads in technical sophistication, utilizing 20+ years of HRV research through patent-protected algorithms (EP1545310A1). The system processes **R-R interval measurements** at millisecond precision, calculating real-time energy levels (0-100 scale) through weighted integration of HRV analysis (~60-70%), activity expenditure (~15-20%), sleep quality (~10-15%), and stress episodes (~5-10%).

**Oura Ring's Readiness Score** implements the most comprehensive multi-dimensional approach, combining HRV Balance, Activity Balance, Sleep Balance, and Recovery Index through **14-day weighted averages** compared against 2-month baselines. The system uniquely integrates **menstrual cycle awareness** and **body temperature deviations** for enhanced personalization.

**WHOOP's Recovery Score** emphasizes continuous HRV monitoring throughout entire sleep periods rather than single-point measurements, coupled with a proprietary **logarithmic strain scaling** system. Their approach achieves high scientific accuracy through **real-time HRV analysis** and comprehensive respiratory rate monitoring.

**Apple's Vitals system** takes a **pattern deviation detection** approach, alerting users when multiple metrics simultaneously fall outside 28-day personal baselines. This conservative methodology prioritizes specificity over sensitivity, requiring multiple biomarkers to indicate fatigue states.

## Biometric Parameters and Their Physiological Roles

### Heart Rate Variability: The Primary Fatigue Indicator

**Technical Implementation:**
HRV serves as the cornerstone of all major fatigue tracking systems, reflecting autonomic nervous system balance through **R-R interval analysis**. The mathematical foundation relies on time-domain and frequency-domain calculations.

**Key Formulas:**
```
RMSSD = √[(1/(N-1)) ∑(i=1 to N-1)(RRᵢ₊₁ - RRᵢ)²]
SDNN = √[(1/(N-1)) ∑(i=1 to N)(RRᵢ - RR̄)²]
LF/HF Ratio = LF_power/HF_power
```

**Physiological Significance:**
- **High RMSSD values** indicate parasympathetic dominance (recovery state)
- **Low RMSSD values** suggest sympathetic activation (fatigue/stress)
- **Optimal measurement window**: 5-minute epochs during stable conditions
- **Required accuracy**: Beat-to-beat precision with millisecond timing

**Platform-Specific Implementations:**
- **Garmin**: Time-domain analysis with artifact correction algorithms
- **Oura**: Continuous overnight RMSSD monitoring with recovery pattern analysis
- **WHOOP**: Averages entire sleep period vs. single-point measurements
- **Apple**: Automatic overnight collection with sophisticated artifact filtering

### Sleep Quality Assessment Algorithms

**Multi-Stage Sleep Detection:**
Commercial devices achieve **86-89% accuracy** for binary sleep/wake classification but show significant limitations in multi-stage detection. **Deep sleep accuracy** peaks at 59% (Google Pixel Watch), while **REM sleep detection** remains challenging across all platforms.

**Mathematical Sleep Modeling:**
Sleep scoring employs **two-process models** combining homeostatic sleep pressure and circadian rhythms:

```
S(t) = S₀ + (t - t₀)/τₛ  (homeostatic pressure)
C(t) = A × cos(2π(t - φ)/24)  (circadian component)
Alertness(t) = C(t) - S(t)
```

**Integration with Fatigue Calculation:**
- **Sleep debt accumulation**: Linear relationship with next-day fatigue levels
- **Sleep efficiency**: Percentage of time actually sleeping vs. time in bed
- **Sleep stage distribution**: REM and deep sleep percentages impact recovery scoring

### VO2max and Cardiovascular Fitness Integration

**Established Mathematical Models:**
```
VO2max = 15.3 × (HRmax/HRrest)  (Heart Rate Ratio Method)
VO2max = 132.853 - 0.0769W - 0.3877A + 6.315G - 3.2649T - 0.1565H  (Rockport)
```

**Garmin's Implementation:**
```
VO2max = 56.363 + 1.921*NPAC - 0.831*Age - 0.754*BMI + 10.978*Sex
```

**Role in Fatigue Assessment:**
VO2max establishes **baseline fitness capacity**, influencing individual fatigue thresholds. Higher cardiovascular fitness correlates with **faster recovery times** and **higher fatigue resistance**.

### Advanced Biometric Parameters

**Respiratory Rate Monitoring:**
- **Normal range**: 12-20 breaths per minute during rest
